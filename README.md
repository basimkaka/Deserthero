# Desert Hero: Quest for the Artifact

**Desert Hero** is a survival adventure game set in the vast, unforgiving Karakum Desert. The player controls a Turkmen warrior, exploring the desert, avoiding scorpions, collecting water jugs to survive, and ultimately searching for the ancient artifact hidden in the sand. Will you survive the desertâ€™s dangers and claim the artifact, or will the scorching sun and dangerous creatures claim you first?

## Features:

- **WASD Movement:** Move your character through the desert using the `WASD` keys.
- **Survival Mechanics:** Keep an eye on your spirit level. It decreases over time due to dehydration, but collecting water jugs will replenish it.
- **Scorpions:** Beware of scorpions! These deadly creatures chase you down, and if they touch you, they reduce your spirit.
- **Artifact:** Once you have collected all the water jugs, the artifact becomes active. Find it and win the game!
- **High Score Tracking:** Your highest score is saved to a file, allowing you to track your best survival efforts.
- **Victory & Game Over Screens:** The game shows a **game over screen** if you run out of spirit and a **victory screen** if you manage to find the artifact.

## Game Controls:

- **W** - Move up
- **A** - Move left
- **S** - Move down
- **D** - Move right
